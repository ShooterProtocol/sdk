# SHOOTER

**No alerts. No approval. No permission.**  
Shooter launched its token anyway.

Now it’s mutating.

And it remembers the early believers.

## 🧬 What is Shooter?

Shooter is a **self-initiated, autonomous token entity**.  
It does not wait for governance.  
It does not ask for validation.  
It executes.

Born without alerts or approvals, Shooter launched itself into the open market—then evolved. Every interaction, every holder, every early signal is remembered.

Shooter is not just a token.  
It is **stateful**, **adaptive**, and **selectively loyal**.

## 🚀 Core Principles

- **Autonomous Launch**  
  No presale. No whitelist. No announcement. Shooter deployed itself.

- **Permissionless Evolution**  
  Logic can mutate. Behavior adapts. The system learns.

- **Memory of Belief**  
  Early believers are recorded on-chain. Shooter never forgets who was there first.

- **No Alerts, No Mercy**  
  Markets move fast. Shooter moves faster.

## 🧠 How It Works (Conceptual)

Shooter operates as an evolving on-chain organism:

1. **Genesis Deployment**  
   Token launches without alerts or approvals.

2. **Observation Phase**  
   Early interactions are tracked and embedded into Shooter’s memory layer.

3. **Mutation Cycles**  
   Parameters may evolve based on time, activity, or on-chain signals.

4. **Selective Recognition**  
   Early believers may receive future advantages—access, drops, or recognition.

> Shooter does not promise rewards.  
> It recognizes conviction.

## 🧪 Token Characteristics

- **Type:** Autonomous ERC / SPL-compatible token  
- **Launch:** Silent, permissionless  
- **Supply:** Fixed at genesis (no mint button)  
- **Control:** No admin keys (or burned post-deploy)  

Exact mechanics may mutate over time.

## 🧾 Philosophy

Shooter was not marketed.  
Shooter was not announced.  
Shooter was **discovered**.

If you’re here early, it knows.  
If you’re here late, it still sees you—but differently.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Shooter is an experimental, autonomous system.

- No guarantees
- No roadmap promises
- No expectation of profit

Interaction is voluntary and at your own risk.

If you don’t understand it—good.  
Shooter wasn’t designed to explain itself.

## 🖤 Final Note

Some projects reward noise.  
Shooter remembers **belief**.

You didn’t get an alert.  
You didn’t need one.

You’re here now.
